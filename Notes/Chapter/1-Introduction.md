# 1 - Introduction

## 1.1 Programming Language

- Programming language: a formal language that specifies a set of instructions for a computer to implement specific algorithms to solve problems

- 1st Generation languages: 
  - Machine language
  - Directly executable by machine
  - Machine dependent
  - Efficient code but difficult to write
- 2nd generation languages:
  - Assembly language
  - Need to be **translated(assembled)** into machine code for execution
  - Efficient code, easier to write than machine code
- 3rd generation language:
  - Closer to English
  - Need to be **translated (complied or interpreted)** into machine code for execution
  - Example: FORTRAN, COBOL, C, BASIC
- 4th generation language:
  - Require fewer instructions than 3GL
  - Used with databases (query languages, report generators, forms designers)
  - Example: SQL, PostScript, Mathematica
- 5th generation language:
  - Used mainly AI research
  - Declarative languages
  - Functional languages (Lisp, Scheme, SML)
  - Logic programming (Prolog)
- “Generational” classification of high level languages (3GL and later) was never fully precise
- A different classification is based on paradigm

### 1.1.1 C Programming Language

- C is an **imperative procedural language (命令式程序语言)**
- C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions
- C is a high-level language very close to the machine level, hence sometimes it is called “mid-level”
